SALES DASHBOARD
Objective:
The objective of my Excel project was to improve my proficiency in using spreadsheets and Excel's features for data cleaning, analysis, and visualization. Through this project, I aimed to enhance my ability to organize and manipulate data, perform calculations and analysis, and create visual representations of data using charts and graphs.

Data gathering & cleaning:
1.For my Excel project, I started by gathering a dataset related to product sales . I downloaded the dataset in its raw format, which was provided in a excel file.

2.To begin the data cleaning process, I imported the file into Excel and created a working sheet to work with a copy of the raw data.

3.I focused on cleaning the data by identifying and removing any duplicate entries. By removing duplicates, I ensured that each product sales record was unique and accurate.

4.I have take some key points from my product sales dataset and create profit values from a total sales and used some basic function formulas from the requirement.

5.Throughout the data cleaning process, my focus was on ensuring data accuracy, consistency, and usability for further analysis and visualization tasks.

Data Processing:
1.Once the data gathering and cleaning phase was completed, I proceeded with data processing in Excel for my project.

2.To begin, I created a separate worksheet dedicated to the analysis and visualization of the product sales data. This worksheet served as the foundation for data processing tasks.

3.One of the key data processing steps I took was the creation of a pivot table. By utilizing Excel's pivot table feature, I was able to summarize and aggregate the product sales data such as total sales,region,product,unit sold,sales persons details.This allowed for easier analysis and visualization of the data.

4.Additionally, I leveraged Excel's charting capabilities to create visual representations of the product sales data. By selecting the appropriate chart types and configuring the data series, I was able to present the insights and trends in a visually appealing manner.

Conclusion:
1.The Excel project focused on analyzing product sales data and presenting key insights using formulas, functions, pivot tables, and charts. The project demonstrated the importance of data cleaning, organization, and visualization in facilitating data analysis and decision-making.

2.The use of pivot tables and charts allowed for a comprehensive visual representation of the data, enabling stakeholders to easily understand sales trends,regions,product performance, and customer satisfaction ratings. The sales dashboard provided a centralized view of the data, aiding in quick analysis and identification of important patterns.

3.Overall, the Excel project enhanced my understanding of spreadsheet functionalities, data cleaning techniques, and data visualization capabilities. It emphasized the significance of accurate and well-organized data in driving effective business decisions.
